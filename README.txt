# Project 1: HTTP Clients and Servers

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SUMMARY ###

- The programs were designed to connect to FOAAS's server to retrieve the appropriate content from the requested URL. 
Then, that content will be passed through the PurgoMalum service to render the redacted message that is suited to the professional language. 
The task works either by a command-line utility or by a client-server model.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### DOCUMENTATION ###
- For program #1, the URL path from the command line will be taken by using sys.argv and used to make a HTTP connection with the header Accept: application/
json. The response wil be deserialized to a string and encoded to be the path URL to Purgo Malum server to get the redact message.
- For program #2, the program will first connect to a local host server then it will do what program #1 do. After that, the redacted message will be display on the webbrower with the template of FOAAS
